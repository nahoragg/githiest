# githiest
A Simple python tool to check the presence of .git in a list of urls. Just provide it with a file containing URL's, domains, subdomains or IP's and it will take care of the rest. To make things faster, multiprocessing is used.

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/nahoragg/githiest.git
```

# Usage

python3 githiest.py <path to file>
```

Ofcourse, you can make changes accroding to your need or suggest some improvements cause it's my first tool!
